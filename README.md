# Side Order Palette Planner

This is a work in progress tool I'm developing to assist in making, sharing, and playing Side Order palettes.

It's primarily designed for people interested in Palette Art, providing drawing tools and (eventually) mechanisms to ensure your palette is possible to complete.

Currently, it is unfinished but in active development as of August 2024.

You are open to make use of this tool in its current state, however please note that **several features are not yet implemented and may not work**.

The CSS is also not yet optimized for many screen sizes, **so it may be difficult or impossible to use depending on your device**. I intend to finish the core featureset first to get a scope of all the elements that will be present, then work on making the layout scale well.

Basically, this is a take it or leave it project for the moment which I wanted to at least get out there in some capacity since I've been working on it for quite a while.

Thanks for your patience, and please enjoy!
